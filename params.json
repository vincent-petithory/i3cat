The script could be:\r\n\r\n\t$ cat ~/.i3/mpd-nowplaying.sh\r\n\t#!/bin/sh\r\n\twhile :; do\r\n\t  echo '[{\"name\":\"mpd\",\"instance\":\"now playing\",\"full_text\":\"ï†˜ '$(mpc current)'\"}]'\r\n\t  sleep 10\r\n\tdone\r\n\r\nEdit `~/.i3/i3cat.conf`:\r\n\r\n\t$ cat i3cat.conf\r\n\t# mpc status\r\n\t~/.i3/mpd-nowplaying.sh\r\n\t# i3 status\r\n\ti3status -c ~/.i3/status\r\n\r\nThe order matters: the output of the commands are sent to i3bar in that order.\r\nLines starting with `#` are comments and ignored.\r\n\r\nNote the JSON output of the script is an array. `i3cat` also supports variants like the output from `i3status`: a i3bar header (or not) followed by an infinite array.\r\n\r\n### More\r\n\r\nRun `i3cat -h` for a list of options:\r\n\r\n    Usage of i3cat:\r\n      -cmd-file=\"$HOME/.i3/i3cat.conf\": File listing of the commands to run. It will read from STDIN if - is provided\r\n      -debug-file=\"\": Outputs JSON to this file as well; for debugging what is sent to i3bar.\r\n      -header-clickevents=false: The i3bar header click_events\r\n      -header-contsignal=0: The i3bar header cont_signal\r\n      -header-stopsignal=0: The i3bar header stop_signal\r\n      -header-version=1: The i3bar header version\r\n      -log-file=\"\": Logs i3cat events in this file. Defaults to STDERR\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\n`i3cat` sends data to i3bar only when necessary: when a command sends an updated output of its blocks, `i3cat` caches it and sends to i3bar the updated output of all blocks, using the latest cached blocks of the other commands. This means commands don't need to have the same update frequency.\r\n\r\nIt is not advised to send SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals to`i3cat`, as its subprocesses will continue to output data anyway.\r\nFor pausing and resuming processing (usually asked by i3bar), `i3cat` will listen for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 for pausing and resuming, respectively. It will then forward the signals specified with `-header-stopsignal` and `-header-contsignal` flags (defaults to SIGSTOP and SIGCONT) to all its managed processes.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n * Expose click events sent by i3bar to i3cat's STDIN\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
